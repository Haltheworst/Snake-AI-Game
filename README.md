# AI Snake Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ§ 

This is a **practice project** where we build an AI agent to play the classic Snake game using **PyTorch** and **Pygame**. The agent learns how to play the game through **Deep Q-Learning**, a form of reinforcement learning.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- Implemented in Python using **PyTorch** for the AI logic and **Pygame** for game rendering.
- Uses **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to allow the snake to learn from its actions and improve over time.
- Trains the model by playing the game repeatedly and learning from its mistakes.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Purpose

This project was done purely for **educational and practice** purposes, as part of learning AI and reinforcement learning techniques applied to game development.

## ðŸŽ¥ Tutorial Credit

The core logic and structure of this project are based on the excellent tutorial by *Python Engineer* on YouTube:
